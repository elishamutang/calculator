# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

This branch solves the following:

Addition functionality seems to be working. Results are being shown on the calculator display. 

The following issues still persist:

1. Create new branch to experiment/test another method of performing addition/subtraction/division/multiplication etc.
2. Add operator functionality, where user clicks on an "operator" (i.e +/-) and that sign is assigned to "operator" variable.
3. From there, pass operator and operands to operate function.
4. Operate function will call the correct operation based on the operator passed.
