# Online interactive calculator with keyboard support!
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

Things to add:
1. When keyboard input is used, make keys react to keypresses and animate them the same way it is clicked using a mouse.
2. Link to GitHub profile on the GitHub logo.
3. Audio effects when user clicks/press calculator keys.

Bug found:
1. When '%' is pressed, without any prior input, user not able to press any more keys.
