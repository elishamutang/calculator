# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

This branch solved the following:

When user clicks "+", it will not show on the calculator display. It will still calculate the sum nonetheless.

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Other arithmetic operations (subtraction/multiplication/division).
2. Chain operations (e.g 12 + 4 - 3 * 5 = 1).
3. Floating numbers.
