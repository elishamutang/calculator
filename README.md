Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

To do:

1. Create new branch to experiment/test another method of performing addition/subtraction/division/multiplication etc.
2. Add operator functionality, where user clicks on an "operator" (i.e +/-) and that sign is assigned to "operator" variable.
3. From there, pass operator and operands to operate function.
4. Operate function will call the correct operation based on the operator passed.
