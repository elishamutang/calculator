# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

This branch solved the following:

1. When user clicks "+", it will not show on the calculator display. It will still calculate the sum nonetheless.
2. Chain operations

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Tweak Equals button. If user repeatedly presses Equals button, what should and should not happen?
2. Tweak chain operations (make 23+7-20/x5 work) (Done)
3. Floating numbers.


Note-to-self: Create a dedicated function for buttons. Don't use forEach. Remove global variables and localize them.
