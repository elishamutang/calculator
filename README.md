# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

This branch solves the following:

Addition functionality seems to be working. Results are being shown on the calculator display. 

The following issues still persist:

1. Operator sign is shown in the operations display. Ideally, operator should not be shown. 
2. Addition should sum 2 operands, if an additional operand (3rd operand) is added, that will be automatically summed with
    previous sum.
