# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Prevent users from entering more than one decimal place.
2. "&" key not coded yet.


Note-to-self: Create a dedicated function for buttons. Don't use forEach. Remove global variables and localize them.
