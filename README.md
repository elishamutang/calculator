Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Tweak code to allow for floating numbers.
2. Don't allow user to enter numbers in the following format 0X where X is a number > 0.


Note-to-self: Create a dedicated function for buttons. Don't use forEach. Remove global variables and localize them.
