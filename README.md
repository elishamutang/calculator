# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

This branch solved the following:

When user clicks "+", it will not show on the calculator display. It will still calculate the sum nonetheless.

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Tweak Equals button. If user repeatedly presses Equals button, what should and should not happen? 
2. Floating numbers.
