Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Tweak Equals button. If user repeatedly presses Equals button, what should and should not happen?
2. Tweak Equals button to function properly with Operators button.
3. Floating numbers.


Note-to-self: Create a dedicated function for buttons. Don't use forEach. Remove global variables and localize them.
