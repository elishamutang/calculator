# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

This branch solved the following:

1. When user clicks "+", it will not show on the calculator display. It will still calculate the sum nonetheless.
2. Chain operations

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. Tweak Equals button. If user repeatedly presses Equals button, what should and should not happen?
2. Tweak operator function. If user presses operators without inputting numbers OR if user presses operator first and then
    followed by a number, what should happen?
3. Floating numbers.


Note-to-self: Create a dedicated function for buttons. Don't use forEach. Remove global variables and localize them.
