# calculator
Final project from The Odin Project's foundations course.

The following questions still need to be answered/coded:

1. "&" key not coded yet.
2. User able to press "." after pressing operator signs.
3. Make totalDisplay show "=" if user presses "=" key.

Note-to-self for future improvements: 

1. Create a dedicated function for buttons. Remove global variables and localize them.
2. Styling of calculator.
